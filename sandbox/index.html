      <h1>Accensum Sandbox</h1>
      <p>We are a U.S.-based R&D holding building next-generation secure systems. Accensum Sandbox is our program for developers, engineers, and mathematicians who want to work on real research in cryptography, OSINT, data modeling, and resilient communications. The program is developed with <strong>Notonomy</strong>, focused on human potential and applied science. If you’re driven by deep tech — we want to hear from you.</p>
      <p><a href="mailto:sandbox@accensum.com">Email</a></p>

      <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
      <p>Our work spans high-impact domains:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Cryptography & Encryption</em> — secure protocols, zero-knowledge, post-quantum resilience</li>
        <li><em>Mathematical Modeling</em> — simulation, optimization, large-scale data processing</li>
        <li><em>OSINT Technologies</em> — automated leak detection, deep-source intelligence, network tracing</li>
        <li><em>Radio-Electronic Systems</em> — robust data transmission, low-signal environments, secure comms</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What We Offer</h3>
      <p>A space to think, build, and be heard. In Sandbox, you’ll:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access research problems from active Accensum projects</li>
        <li>Attend lectures and workshops by our engineers</li>
        <li>Propose solutions and get <strong>paid for viable ideas</strong></li>
        <li>Work asynchronously, on your terms</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to Join</h3>
      <p>Invites are distributed after CEO talks at tech events. If you weren’t there — write to us.</p>
      <p>Send an email to <a href="mailto:sandbox@accensum.com">sandbox@accensum.com</a> with the subject: <strong>Sandbox Application</strong>.</p>
      <p>Tell us in your own words:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Who you are — even if you’re just starting</li>
        <li>Why you care about secure, intelligent systems</li>
        <li>Any project, idea, or curiosity you’d like to explore</li>
      </ul>
